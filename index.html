** Please run this on-device from either Safari/Chrome/Firefox, etc. browsers (And yes, these links were all tested from within even the Messages and Notes apps even, it literally works that way as well). (and no, neither a computer or Cydia Impactor is required for this) **

NOTE: These were made possible by ayouch/others; this is just mirroed so the links do't get taken down for whatever reason (but they theoretically *shouldn't*, but it's always a great idea to have a backup mirror link at your disposal anyhow :P)
