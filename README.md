My website, which is <b>super</b> incomplete still... It has no CSS engine, no JavaScript engine, no HTML5 engine, none of the fancy stuff you find on most other Cydia repositories or any other tweak developers' webistes, especially on other tweak developers' sites that **actually contain a bio about the developer** in question... maybe this will get beefed up and designated to a better and suitable page layout that was <b>programmed and written by me</b> accordingly very soon... but for now, I literally only use this layout (and it admittedly is just simply <b>copied and pasted code from Luca Todesco's yalu.qwertyoruiop.com page layout as a temporary layout</b>)... little embarrassing, but yes, I do intend to fix this soon... Seldom are people finding this site "useless", thankfully. We'll seek a better outcome soon... Please don't judge a book by it's cover. :/
